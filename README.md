The code was tested on an Arduino based microcontroller(Uno) using the MPU 6050 as the IMU. 
The controller design was done in MATLAB after identifying the single axis transfer function of the setup. 
The transfer function was computed using data based system identification techniques.

The code covers PID control for single axis stablization of our setup and lead/lag compensation based control.
